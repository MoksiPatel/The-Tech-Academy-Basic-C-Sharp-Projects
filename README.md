# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .Net Framwork.


# Projects:
- [Method Class](https://github.com/MoksiPatel/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/master/MethodClassAssignment)
- [Operators](https://github.com/MoksiPatel/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/master/OperatorsAssignment)
- [Polymorphism](https://github.com/MoksiPatel/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/master/PolymorphismAssignment)


## Method Class
This program creates a void method that takes two integers as parameters. Have the method do a math operation on the first integer and display the second integer to the screen.

## Operators
This program compares two employees to se if they are same by overload the "==" operator.


## Polymorphism
This program create an interface called IQuittable and have it define a void method called Quit(). The Employee class from the previous drill inherit that interface and implement the Quit() method in any way you choose. It uses polymorphism to create an object of type IQuittable and call the Quit() method on it. Hint: an object can be of an interface type if it implements that specific interface.
